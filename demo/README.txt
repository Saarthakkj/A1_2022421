Library System
This is a simple library system written in Java. It allows users to either enter as a librarian or as a member. The system provides various functionalities such as adding books, borrowing books, and displaying the library menu.

Getting Started
To get started with the library system, make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can then compile and run the Library class.

Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu consisting of three options:

Enter as a librarian
Enter as a member
Exit
If you choose option 1, you will be prompted to enter your name and phone number. The system will then check if you are a registered member. If you are, you will be able to access the librarian menu.

If you choose option 2, you will also be prompted to enter your name and phone number. The system will then check if you are a registered member. If you are, you will be able to access the member menu.

If you choose option 3, the program will exit.

Requirements
Java
Scanner class for user input

This code contains classes and methods for managing members and books in a library system. Here's a breakdown of the code:

member_manager class
This class manages a list of members.
It has a method checkMember to check if a member with a given name and phone number exists in the list of members.
member class
This class represents a member in the library system.
It has private instance variables such as name, phoneno, ID, issuedBooks, booksformember, and Fine.
The generateID method generates a unique ID for each member by combining the first three characters of the name and the first five characters of the phone number.
The check method is used to check if a given member exists.
The available_books method lists all the available books in the library.
The issuebook method is used to issue a book to a member. It adds the book to the member's list of issued books and reduces the number of available copies of the book.
The returnBook method is used to return a book. It removes the book from the member's list of issued books, adds it back to the library's list of books, and calculates any fine due based on the time the book was issued and the time it was returned.
The toString method returns a string representation of the member.
The calculateFine method calculates the fine for a book based on the time it was issued and the time it was returned.
The displaymenu method displays a menu of options for the member to interact with the library system.
Usage
To use the code, you can create instances of the member class and call its methods to manage members and books in the library system. You can also use the member_manager class to manage a list of members.

Please note that the code provided is incomplete and may require additional implementation to work properly.

This is a Java program that implements a simple library management system. It allows librarians to register members, remove members, add books, remove books, view all members along with their books and fines, and view all books in the library.
